# E-commerce Customer Segmentation

## Abstract

E-commerce businesses faced a key challenge in analyzing trends in the market to increase their sales. The trend could be easily observed if companies could group customers based on their activity on the e-commerce site. This grouping was done by applying different criteria like previous orders and mostly searched brands.

## Problem Statement

Given the e-commerce data, the k-means clustering algorithm was used to cluster customers with similar interests.

## Dataset Information

The data was collected from a well-known e-commerce website over a period of time based on the customers' search profiles.

- Analyzed the existing customer data and obtained valuable insights about the purchase pattern.
- Conducted data pre-processing, including missing value treatment.
- Segmented customers based on the optimum number of clusters ('k') with the help of silhouette score.

## Variable Description

- **Cust_ID:** Unique numbering for customers.
- **Gender:** Gender of the customer.
- **Orders:** Number of orders placed by each customer in the past.
- **Remaining 35 features (brands):** Contains the number of times customers have searched them.

## Tools and Techniques used in this Project involves
- Python programming
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Data Analysis 
- Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm - K Means Clustering - for model building
